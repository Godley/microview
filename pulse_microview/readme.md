Very simple mashup of the sparkfun microview love heart demo, and the pulse sensor LED pulse demo.
All you need to do is install the microview libraries: https://github.com/geekammo/MicroView-Arduino-Library/ and the pulsesensor.com libraries, plug in your pulse sensor to analog pin 0
and away you go!
